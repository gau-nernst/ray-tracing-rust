# Ray Tracing in One Weekend - Rust Edition

[_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io)

Also check out my [ray-tracing-numba](https://github.com/gau-nernst/ray-tracing-numba)

The main purpose of this project is for me to learn Rust. Some lessons:

1. This approach is not so wise. I need to learn Rust and ray-tracing at the same time. Apart from the mathetics, the design aspect of a ray-tracing codebase is also something I'm not familiar with. Therefore, I could not focus solely on learning Rust. Perhaps I should implement something that I know well (e.g. Word2Vec that I previously implemented with Numba) instead.

2. Rust is known for its safety, not for its ease of use for computation. If I want to focus on writing code for fast computation, perhaps other languages that are specifically designed for the purpose are better suited, such as Julia.

3. It's easy to write slow code for Rust. I had an old ray-tracing implementation in Numba (I probably should update it, should be interesting). I have a feeling the Numba version is faster than my Rust version. Theorectically Rust can be fast, but I don't know it well enough to optimize it.
